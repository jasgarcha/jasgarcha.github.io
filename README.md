This repository consists of the source code for my homepage. All the files in this repo exhibit my initial journey in programming HTML, CSS, and JavaScript; specifically, they highlight my implementation of essential web development concepts, such as Responsive Web Design, and the addition of complex libraries and frameworks (jQuery and Bootstrap). I ventured deeper into Full Stack development with this background.

For security reasons, I have removed the API key in my source code required to use the search. A functional demo of the search and therefore download of search results is hosted @ https://venus.cs.qc.cuny.edu/~gaja9141/search.html. However, I have provided sample CSV, XML, and JSON files downloaded from the search query "CUNY Tech Prep" in the /Search Results To Upload/ folder. Please download and then upload them to the search page to witness how my front-end reconstitutes the query metadata that I grabbed client-side.
