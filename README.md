This repository consists of the source code for my homepage. The files in this repo (index.html, index.css, and index.js) all exhibit my successful experience in programming HTML, CSS, and JavaScript; specifically, they highlight my implementation of essential web development concepts, such as Responsive Web Design, through complex libraries and frameworks, namely jQuery and Bootstrap. With this background, I ventured deeper into Full Stack development, along with my solid foundation in SQL, to React and Next.js.
